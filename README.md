### Technology

I started working on this project on August 2019, and the first release was in March 2020. The project is mostly written in kotlin, though there are other languages present:
* kotlin
* java
* xml

I used MVVM, Repository, dependency injection, Firebase as a backend service, Single activity design patterns (there is a second activity but it is a small one: AuthActivity). 

I used various libraries in production: 
* Dagger2, 
* Glide, 
* Stfalcon ImageViewer, 
* Matisse Image picker, 
* AnderoidX Room, 
* Navigation, 
* Viewpager2, 
* WorkManager, 
* Coroutines, 
* Motion layout.
